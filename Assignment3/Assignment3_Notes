Important points noted:

1. For same train-test split, SVM with 'rbf' kernel gives 0.5577 accuracy 
   while SVC with 'linear' kernel gives 0.8077 accuracy.
   Data may be linearly separable. 

2. In decision tree, as the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node increased,
   The accuracy decreased. The Graph is plotted and the value with highest accuracy is choosen.
